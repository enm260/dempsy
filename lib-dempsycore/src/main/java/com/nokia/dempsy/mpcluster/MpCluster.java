/**
 * <p>This interface represents a means of accessing the current state of a cluster.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An Mp cluster is the set of Mp containers that all have the same Mp prototype in them.
 * The collection of all instances of an Mp container that contain the same Mp prototype 
 * is considered an "Mp cluster."</p>
 * 
 * <p>Therefore an instance of an MpCluster represents a handle to the meta-data for 
 * an entire distributed set of Mp prototypes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This handle can be used to access "slots." It is not necessarily the case that there 
 * is a one to one relationship between a "slot" and a node on a network containing an instance
 * of an Mp container but it is possible. That choice is dependent on the MpCluster implementation
 * and its use within Dempsy.
 * 
 * See the ZookeeperCluster for an example where this isn't the case.
